#Situaton where too many attributes cab be problematic

1. Creation of Objects
2. Validate the properties before object creation



#Problems

1. we need to remember the order of arguments, making it hard to maintain.
2. what if we want to have optional arguments , we will be force to manually give some default values to constructor


#Benefits

1. Easy to do validation


# the problem of forcefully passing arguments can be solved by constructor overloading.
    1. constructor explosion
    2. a few constructor will cause issue.


# SOlution is using getter and setter
    # Benefits
        1. Readable
        2. Manageable
        3. Extendible
    # Issue
        1. how to validate before object creation
        2. Not work for immutable object creation

-  just using setters will not work
-  having too many arguments in the constructor will not work


# what if we have all the arguments which are passed in constructor stored in a data structure.
