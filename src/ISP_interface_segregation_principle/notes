an entity may be composed of a combination of behaviours
it might not have all the possible behaviour

if we violate this we will be forced to implement methods which are not associated to us


ISP states that no childclass should be forced to exhibit a behaviour

this happens because of bulky interfaces/abstract classes

ISP is SRP for interfaces

so try to segregate behaviour into different interfaces
